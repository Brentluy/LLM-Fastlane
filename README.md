# üß† LLM Quiz App: Learn Fast, Remember Forever 

---

## üßæ Introduction / È°πÁõÆÁÆÄ‰ªã

Hi there! I'm a graduate student at **Carnegie Mellon University**, currently navigating the tough waters of job hunting. Along the way, I realized that many concepts from **LLM**, **Data Science**, and **Machine Learning Engineering (MLE)**‚Äîthough taught in class‚Äîhad long slipped from memory.

I found most fast-track materials online to be either low-quality or scattered. And reading text-heavy resources? Let‚Äôs be real: read the top, forget the bottom.  
So‚Ä¶ is there a better way to **learn fast and remember deeply**?

> üí° Based on my CFA and FRM cram experience: **Quizzes** are the fastest way to learn.  
> Instant feedback keeps your brain alert and memory sharp.

That‚Äôs why I built this app: a 100% **free**, **open-source**, and **quiz-based** learning platform for LLMs and beyond.

## ü§ñ Why Gemini? / ‰∏∫‰ªÄ‰πàÈÄâ GeminiÔºü

Honestly? Just milking that sweet, sweet Google compute üêÆ

I discovered that using **Gemini Canvas**, you can run advanced code and get free API access‚Äîjust by signing into a Google account. No backend setup, no billing, no limits (yet). It‚Äôs perfect for building shareable apps.  
And the UI? Don‚Äôt like it? Just tell Gemini to fix it. It'll do exactly that.  
Thank you Google!

## ‚≠ê Give a Star? / Êù•È¢ó Star ÂêßÔºü

If you find this project useful, please consider giving it a üåü!  
This was built with caffeine, determination, and a lot of job rejection emails. I hope it helps you learn faster and smarter.
